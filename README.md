FOrmal CinemAtics ontoLogy


FOCAL (FOrmal CinemAtics ontoLogy) conceptualises and formalises movies' content, in a format which machines can easily understand. In order to achieve this goal, it proposes an ontology, an explicit specification tool that models a domain of knowledge. The case study for the application of Focal is Memento (2001), a movie written and directed by Christopher Nolan.

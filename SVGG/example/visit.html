<i>ViRS</i> Museum expands over a total area of <b>710 square meters</b> and, as already anticipated in the Home section (<a href="../../index.html" target="_blank"><i>The PROJECT</i></a>),
it is organized into a long path composed of <b>12 areas</b> (separated in six main rooms and six smaller corridors).
</p>
<p class="mb-3" align="justify">

}

function normalI(x) {

}
</script>

<p class="mb-3" align="justify">
The reason of the strumental division between rooms and corridors is to be found in the alternation between:
<ul>
<li>the areas that present the real <b>activities</b> (traditional and/or virtual), correlated with <b>artifacts</b> dated 90-100 BC recovered from the shipwreck (i.e. the <b>rooms</b>);
<li>the areas that carry the <b>storytelling</b> (i.e. the <b>corridors</b>), positioned between the main rooms described in the point above.
</ul>
</p>
<p class="mb-3" align="justify">
Below, the left-image presents the main rooms of the museum, while the image on the right displays the corridors.
</p>
<p class="mb-3" align="justify">


<img src="img/map/mapdouble2.png" class="rounded center" style="width: 80%" alt="">

<p class="mb-3" align="justify">
The function of the corridors is of outmost importance, as they present the <b>storytelling</b> that connects all the areas of the museum transforming each of them as a sort 
of chapter telling part of a lost <b>tale of the sea</b>. 
</p>
<p class="mb-3" align="justify">
Regarding its definition, as stated in the British Museum guide "<a href="https://www.britishmuseum.org/PDF/storytelling_resource_changed_font_size.pdf" target="_blank"><i>Fieldnotes Storytelling</i></a>",
the storytelling is the act of sharing and shaping stories, in this case drawing <b>links between past, present and future</b> and bringing to life the human presence behind <b>ancient objects</b>.
They, in facts, can be used as anchors and triggers for a huge range of <b>stories</b>, both factual and <b>fictional</b>: in <i>ViRS</i> museum, the storytelling is <b>narrative</b> and
always follows the visitors, from the very first area to the last one. Its core is a <b>love story with uncertain ending</b>: the ancient Roman <b>Captain</b> of the ship that nowadays lays at the bottom of the sea
sails promising his <b>beloved</b> that, when he returns home, he would ask her to <b>marry</b> him. But eventually, the <b>sinking</b> of the ship leaves her alone, watching the sea, without knowing 
if he would ever come back, but full of <b>hope</b> and prayers to the Gods. 
<br>
More about the storytelling of <i>ViRS</i>, the setting, the protagonists and the frames, is displayed at each corridor, down in this page.
</p>
<p class="mb-3" align="justify">
As stated in the article "<i><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.2151-6952.2001.tb00027.x" target="_blank">Storytelling: The Real Work of Museums</a></i>" 
(Bedford, 2010), stories are <b>powerful</b> because they "do not fill in all the blanks". They open up a space 
into which the listener’s <b>own feelings</b>, thoughts, and memories can flow and expand, carrying their life experiences and their dreams.
They <b>inspire</b> an internal dialogue and thus ensure a real connection. Visitors are thus invited to leave 
their everyday-life stories, to imagine themselves in an unfamiliar world, where the main question about the wonderful adventure they are experiencing is full of curiosity:
<b>how will it end</b>?
</p>
<p class="mb-3" align="justify">
Moreover, the connection of the participants to the environment and to the objects in the museum enhances the <b>memorability</b> of the presented information, the 
creation of stronger <b>emotional bonds</b> with the visitors and the probability of the own <b>re-thinking</b> about the exhibit.

			The visit of <i>ViRS</i> consists in six <b>macro-areas</b> (named "<b>rooms</b>") surrounded by the same number of corridors. These macro-areas
			has been conceived to cover the main steps of the <b>rise (and fall)</b> of a big ancient Roman cargo ship:
			<ul>
			<br>
			<li>the <b>building</b>, in a Roman-like port (code name of the room: <a href="#building">"Building"</a>);
			<li>the <b>navigation</b> towards the blue horizon, once the construction has been completed (in room: <a href="#navigation">"Navigation"</a>);
			<li>the approaching of a huge <b>storm</b> (in room: <a href="#storm">"Storm"</a>);
			<li>the struggle of the <b>sinking</b>, due to the storm (room: <a href="#sinking">"Sinking"</a>);
			<li>the new life <b>underwater</b>, as a shipwreck that slowly becomes an environment of transformation for marine fauna (in room: <a href="#underwater">"Underwater"</a>);
			<li>the <b>recovering</b> of the shipwreck, in modern days, and the precious <b>rediscovery</b> of its artifacts (in room: <a href="#recovering">"Recovering"</a>).
			</ul>
			</p>
			<p class="mb-3" align="justify">
			As described in the heading of this page, these steps and the facts that they brings, rather than being coldly displayed in a series of artifacts and expositive panels,
			are enhanced through a <b>story</b> that features the Captain of the ship as a protagonist, in a one-way journey into the dangerousness and insecurities of the sea.
			</p>
			<p class="mb-3" align="justify">
			<b>But it's not over here. </b>
			</p>
			<p class="mb-3" align="justify">
			The pursuing of a stronger emotional bond and a more involved audience is also achieved by the state-of-the-art <b>technologies</b> and by
			the almost infinite amount of <b>activities</b> that nowadays they can provide. In <i>ViRS</i> museum it has been chosen to propose these types of <b>experiences</b>:
			<ul>
			<li><b>projections</b>, projections... and more projections...
			<ul>
				<li>...some of them carrying the <b>storytelling</b> (in the corridors);
				<li>...some of them with <b>sensors</b> activated by <b>gestures</b> and/or just by visitors’presence (in rooms: <a href="#navigation">"Navigation"</a>, <a href="#underwater">"Underwater"</a>);
			</ul>
			<li><b>reconstruction of real broken artifacts</b> (helmets and armours) with <b>AR</b> tablets by means of QR codes (in room <a href="#storm">"Storm"</a>);
			<li>a <b>360° VR immersive experience</b> without headsets (in room: <a href="#sinking">"Sinking"</a>);
			<li>a <b>treasure hunt</b> for 4 visitors with 4 <b>VR HMD</b> (in room: <a href="#underwater">"Underwater"</a>);
			<li><b>fish-making</b> and amphorae-making on screens, i.e. the customization of a personal fish and/or a personal amphora that immediately appears in the video-projections
			of the walls inside the room, to be seen by all the visitors (in room: <a href="#underwater">"Underwater"</a>);			
			</ul>

			and ordered <b>presentation</b> of the features and the details of the visit!

			  The projection is situated only on the East-wall, since the other sides are already occupied by the artifacts. It shows the <b>slow building</b> of the ship, with <b>no big changes</b>:
			  this is due to the fact that the projection is a <b>30-minutes loop</b> so that visitors entering in each time do not have the feeling that something has already begun and they need
			  to wait for it to restart. The <b>Captain</b> is situated on the foreground, near his beloved: they are looking at the <b>seamen</b> and the builders who carry the material (wood, metal, nails, cases) needed to build the large ship.
       		  <b>Citizens</b> from all social classes, dressed in traditional Roman-like clothes, also occupy the scenario, passing from time to time, to show a real cross-section of 
			  a lively city part of the Roman Empire of the first century BC.

			  learning from a simple static view of the details to a <b>game interaction</b>. Secondly, it grants the possibility to blind the visitors to have an idea about the shape and

			  Left behind the tearful farewell to his beloved, the Captain have sailed from the port and is now in the middle of the sea, with the blue horizon in front of him and
			  his crew, the sun shining over their heads, the twirls of the seagulls and the smell of salty marine life.

			  Once again, the setting is peaceful and in harmony with nature and with the life of the seamen, that must be balanced to ensure everyone's safety. First of all,

			  <b>walkable 1:2 scale reproduction of the cargo ship</b>. One of the main interesting features about it is that the floor is <b>transparent</b> and allows the visitors to see the
			  view of the amphorae below their feet, placed according to the original arrangement of the load. 
			  The left-figure below shows an example of the disposition of

			  , allowing the visitors to walk over a fully <b>reconstructed hull</b>, populated with the real amphorae recovered from the bottom of the sea.

			  <img src="img/map/zroom2a.png" class="rounded right mt-2" style="width: 20%;" alt="">
			  On the glass-floor and in the middle of the ship, several cases exposes different artifacts:
			  <ul>
			  <li align="justify">of course, the <b>Italic Dressel 1B wine amphora</b> (average height 112/120 cm, capacity 26 liters), with an upside-down flared rim, tapered downwards, tall, slender and 
			      cylindrical tip. Most of the amphorae carried by the Abenga's ship contained wine from Campania or from some other site on the Tyrrhenian side of central-southern Italy, while 
				  other oil. Some, again, only <b>hazelnuts</b> that once analyzed were found to be of the species <i> corylus avellana </i>;
		      <li align="justify"><b>black ceramics</b>, placed in piles in the empty spaces between the amphorae. It had been manufactured in Campania and southern Italy and is mainly made of 
			      <b>plates</b> and <b>cups</b> also characterized by reddish-colored clay;
			  <li align="justify">other numerous <b>ceramic containers</b> (jars, pitchers, jugs, pans) that were used in the kitchen and even in the caboose of the ship;
			  <li align="justify"><b>cork stoppers</b> (<i> quercus suber </i>) of an average diameter of 7 cm, placed in the narrowest part of the neck of the amphora, and in turn sealed by lime mortar. 
			      Under the cork, in some cases, the presence of a <b>pine cone</b> was noticed, fixed deeply in the neck, for aromatic purposes, to preserve the taste of the wine during the long journey.
			  <li align="justify">a <b>horn</b> depicting the imprint inside a mutton's horn of a ram's one, made with molten lead. Probably it was placed in the terminal part of the bow 
			      or in the upper part of the ship's cabin, with superstitious meaning against the curses or the evil eye. Others say that this kind of object was usually placed on the 
				  mast of the boat to absorb the electric sparks produced during the storms and known in the Middle Ages as "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Elmo%27s_fire" target="_blank">St.Elmo's fires</a>";
			  <img src="img/artifacts/ruota.png" class="rounded right mt-2" style="width: 30%;" alt="">
			  <li align="justify">a <b>wheel</b> with an irregular diameter of 38 cm and of about 100 kg, fused in a single piece of lead and with a light bronze veil in the upper part. 
			      Probably it was needed to maneuver the main sail of the ship, tightening the thick cable connecting the mast to the stern and to the bow. 
				  Another hypothesis sees it as part of a machine used for the manufacture of lines (/ropes) on board, in order to twist single garments to create more consistent and robust lines;
			  <li align="justify">a lead <b>crucible</b> (of height 14 cm, and average diameter 15 cm), made with a hard and quartz mineral with remains of pure lead deposited in the internal concavity. It  
			     had to be used to melt lead for the most urgent weld and repairs on board;
			  <li align="justify"><b>game pawns</b> in glass paste (<i>calculi</i> or <i>latruncoli</i>);
			  <li align="justify"><b>fishing leads</b> or small soundings;
			  <li align="justify"><b>fragments of oil lamps</b>;
			  <li align="justify">a large <b>lead container</b>;
			  <li align="justify"><b>bronze nails</b> of different shapes and sizes.

			  In 1950 and later in 1962, eight <b>bronze helmets</b> and several pieces of <b>armors</b> were found in the Albenga wreck. This type of finding had led to the supposition 
			  that a cargo ship of that size could require an <b>armed military guard</b>, unless the helmets were part of the normal <b>on-board equipment</b>, to be used for protection in cases 
			  of attack by <b>pirates</b> or other enemies, which at the beginning of the first century BC had to be particularly frequent. The intensification of underwater researches and 
			  archaeological discoveries has now shown that the presence of helmets on board was a very recurrent fact, especially on the wrecks of the first century BC. 
			  Moreover, the fact that helmets found on the same ship present rather remarkable differences between them makes one think more of an <b>improvised army</b> than of a real and stable

A virtual reconstruction of an ancient <b>sinking</b> in the middle of a <b>huge storm</b> is what is here employed to arouse <b>wonder</b> and <b>amazement</b> in the visitors.
The strong <b>emotional bond</b> that has been inserted on purpose since the first corridor of the museum with the protagonist, the Captain Marcus, causes an even bigger
involvement of the visitors into the experience. Standing up on a <b>walkable glass observation bridge</b>, they are free to move and to observe a full immersive <b>360° projection</b> (on
the floor situated approx. 1.5 meter under the glass bridge, on the walls and on the ceiling) inside a room with size <b>105 sqm</b> (7 x 15 meters).
<img src="img/shipwreck2.jpg" class="rounded right mt-2 mb-0" style="width: 40%" alt="">
 The subject of
the 360° projection is the <b>shipwreck</b>: the visitors will experience the ship and its crew fight against the huge waves of the sea, moving from the left wall to the right one,
at the mercy of <b>Neptune</b>'s capricious and unpredictable will. The involvement and the participation of the visitors is also enhanced by the presence of little <b>hiddle fans</b> that,
once again like in the corridor 
<img src="img/shipwreck.jpg" class="rounded left mt-3 mb-0" style="width: 40%" alt="">
'<a href="#rain">Rain and waves</a>' simulate the presence of the winds, and occasionally few drops of water, for a <b>4D experience</b>.
The session <b>lasts 9 minutes</b> before the North-side door opens so that they can move to the underwater setting of the <a href="#goingunderwater">next corridor</a>.
For safety reasons, this room is <b>not suitable</b> for vertigo-sufferers, kids under 6-years-old and elderly visitors. For this viewers, it has been conceived an <a href="#alternative">alternative
corridor</a> next to the room, running to the West-side of it, where they can experience the sinking of the ship without 
<img src="img/shipwreck0.jpg" class="rounded right mt-2 mb-0" style="width: 37%" alt="">fear, uncomfortableness or unpleasant symptoms.
Nonetheless, people with physical disabylities or in wheelchair can experience it, since the corridor has an appropriate width (approx. 2 meters).

the creation of an amphora or a fish), the <b>setting</b> is populated by seaweed, rocks, default amphorae and few particular fish. When a user starts to add new items (fish/amphora)
to the environment, an invisible clock starts for each of them: the maked-items have an <b>expiration time</b> of 40 min, which is more than the average time dedicated to this room
and to the inner one, with the VR game. All the fish on the setting (default or maked) are characterized by a <b>real-like behaviour</b> when a visitor approaches to them, or touch them on the walls: 
this behaviour triggers a quick get-away, made by means of <b>motion sensors</b> placed on the ceiling. The .gif here displayed comes from a part of the Youtube video 
'<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBIE8QF8oy8" target="_blank">Virtual Gulf Stream Aquarium: Interactive Digital Wall Projection</a>', a large-scale audio visual 
interactive wall projection inside the Patricia and Phillip Frost Museum of Science in Miami.

Occasionally, a predator like a <b>shark</b> or another

crosses the ceiling, arousing the astonishment of the visitors, especially the younger ones.
Ideally, one of these large animals should pass <b>every 15 minutes</b>, that is the time that is certainly spent by each visitor inside the room, and that can easily be 
waited (30 minutes) in the case a return of another shark is desired.

As already mentioned in the previous sections, this area comes with an inner room: this room is has got <b>glass walls</b>, so that the visitors can see the activity made
by other users and, perhaps, feel their curiosity increase. The outer room, with its Fish-making and sea-projections, had the function to amaze the viewers and
to provide the general 'underwater' setting that was needed after the sinking of the ship. But those feature could belong to any acquarium in the world: now, with the
<b>trasure hunt</b> activity, made with <b>VR headsets</b>, the visitors return again to the adventures of the shipwreck of Albenga and, thus, to the 
vicissitudes of Captain Marcus and his crew.
<img src="img/underwater/vr9.jpg" class="rounded right mt-3 mb-1" style="width: 50%" alt="">

The target users are four at a time, and they must be at least nine years old (for safety reasons), and the game can also be experienced by visitors in wheelchairs. Each session is composed by
four different <b>steps</b>:
<ul>
<li align="justify">An <b>introductory tutorial</b> made on a LCD screen on one of the glass walls, 
consisting of a <b>speech</b> made by Captain Marcus, survived the sinking of the ship. He is floating in the water leaning against a piece of wood and asking
the visitors-players to recover his <b>wedding ring</b>, the one that he will
bring to Livia to marry him, once back home;

The tutorial is made on a LCD screen (the little and horizontal light blue line in the right-image) in the first part of the glass room.
The <b>Captain Marcus</b> is alone in the sea, clinging to a wooden plank. He addresses to the four players as “<b>creatures sent by the gods</b>” because of their strange clothes 
and beg them to bring him <b>Livia’s wedding ring</b>.
He doesn't explain how to move the controllers (it would be logically impossible since he has never seen before the visitors’ equipment): this is up to the staff.

The game is <b>single-player</b> but with multi-player visualization (i.e. the other participants’ avatars are shown in the game).
The goal is to find Livia's <b>wedding ring</b>, so that Captain Marcus can marry her, once back home. 
The <b>position</b> of the ring in the site is <b>casually recreated</b> each time the players start a new game, to ensure unpredictability and the possibility of users
to try again the game. There is the <b>possibility to grasp</b> the ring, by means of the controllers, but also rocks and pieces of woods that lay on the seabed.

<p class="mb-3" align="justify">
<img src="img/underwater/vrrr.png" class="rounded right mt-1 mb-0" style="width: 50%" alt="">
The game <b>scenario</b> has a realistic representation:
it is composed by the ship, unreachable and on the background, lying on the sand, and a real-life representation of the <b>actual disposition of the amphorae</b>, the one that
nowadays is situated 1.5 km from the coast of Albenga, and is depicted in the image on the right. Different kinds of <b>Mediterranean fish</b>
populate the scenario, among with seaweed. There aren’t dangerous creatures.

The headset that had been chosen for the game is the <b><a href="https://www.vive.com/eu/product/" target="_blank">HTC Vive VR headset</a></b>.
In both the controllers, the central button is used to grasp objects from the seabed.
The <b>interface</b> is given by the <b>player’s hands</b>, with which he or she can grasp rocks, wood and the ring.
As displayed in the image below and on the left, a small <b>timer</b> in a corner indicates the remaining time, from 10 to 0 minutes.
In the image on the right, instead, it is shown how the player can <b>easily see  other players’ avatars</b>, but will never see himself. In order to avoid difficult
personalizations of the character used in the game, female and male avatars are <b>identical</b> (because covered by wetsuits and diving masks).

The player can freely move in a <b>4 x 4.5 metres room</b> with glass walls, but to prevent him or her from hitting the real walls, 

a grid appears in the interface of the game when he or she approaches to the borders of the virtual space.
<img src="img/underwater/grid.jpg" class="rounded center mt-3 mb-3" style="width: 40%" alt="">
When one of the player has <b>found the ring</b>, they all can choose to remain in the game and explore the area until the timer counts zero.

This area (<b>42 sqm</b>) is dedicated to a series of <b>explanatory panels</b> that progressively show the <b>deterioration</b> of the underwater ship. In this way, the visitors are gently transported away
from the 100BC, in order to return to present days.

As Paul Beilstein, from the Underwater Archaeological Society of British Columbia, <a href="http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/edu/ViewLoitDa.do;jsessionid=9B7DD530CCF167218C36AEF937924735?method=preview&lang=EN&id=21340"> states</a>,</p>

			<i>&laquo;People have this <b>misconception</b> that when ships sink, they remain largely <b>intacked</b>, much like a Walt Disney film. It's far from that, in fact ship tend 
			to <b>deteriorate</b> very quickly in our waters because of wave action, wood boring worms and the weight of the ship its self. So what we are left with is this skeleton, 
			and the skeleton is what is fascinating to us as shipwreck enthusiasts. [...] they are true puzzle that need to be explained, understood, measured and categorized 
			as ship wrecks&raquo;</i></p>
<img src="img/sunken2.png" class="rounded right mt-2 mb-0 " style="width: 40%" alt="">
<p class="mb-3" align="justify">Over time, in fact, the shipwreck can flatten and cover the <b>sea floor</b>, almost like a second skin. If it is made of wood, like in this case, 
only the <b>lead sheets</b> and the <b>bronze equipments</b> will remain, while the <b>wooden parts</b> such as the ribs or the plating will be left only if covered by the sand on the bottom of the
sea. The ship has to contend with the <b>tides and currents</b>, which carry its superficial wooden pieces away.</p>
<img src="img/fish.png" class="rounded left mt-0 mb-1" style="width: 40%" alt="">
<p class="mb-3" align="justify">The reason why shipwrecks look different underwater is because they become host to a diverse <b>ecosystem</b>. In effect, the shipwreck becomes a new real 
artificial <b>reef</b>. Beautiful animals such as orange and white anemones often cover whole sections and strange looking white tubeworms can make a wreck look otherworldly. 
The wooden parts also provide food for this new ecosystem.</p>

<p class="mb-3" align="justify">Nowadays, the shipwreck of Albenga is located <b>42 meters below sea level</b> and it shows up to the divers like a <b>field of amphorae</b>, ceramics and remains,

<img src="img/artiglio.png" class="rounded right mb-1" style="width: 35%" alt="">
In Italy the <b>first wreck</b> destined to be object of systematic exploration was precisely the one of Albenga. This enterprise, which in fact marks the <b>birth of 
Mediterranean underwater archeology</b>, started with the discovery, in the sea around Albenga, of Dressel 1B amphorae dispersed on the seabed and by the signal of 
the local fisherman Antonio Bignone, who had fished out the first three amphorae already in <b>1925</b>. This led to the larger discovery of a wreck of a Roman ship sunk about km. 
1.5 from the coast. The first exploration of the wreck, realized by <b><a href="https://viaf.org/viaf/46753287/" targe="_blank">Nino Lamboglia</a></b>, pioneer of Mediterranean 
underwater archeology, took place between <b>8 and 20 February 
1950</b> with the use of the "<b>Artiglio</b>" ship. 
<img src="img/benna.jpg" class="rounded left mb-1 mt-2" style="width: 35%" alt="">
The enterprise had an enormous echo both among scholars and the general public, even beyond national borders, 
despite the <b>limited and inadequate means</b> available at that time to the "Artiglio" divers and, in particular, the use of rudimentary tools like the bucket (i.e. the grasp, in the image on the left), 
which caused damage to the wreck. In less than a month <b>728 amphorae</b> constituting the main load were recovered, associated with piles of plates and black-glazed ceramic cups,
which traveled as accompanying goods placed in the voids between the amphorae.
</p>
<img src="img/recovering.png" class="rounded right mt-2 mb-2" style="width: 35%" alt="">
<p class="mb-3" align="justify">  
Professor Nino Lamboglia described the experience on the second day of the campaign, living it in first person. 
As translated from "N. Lamboglia, <i><b>Excavation diary on board of the "Artiglio"</i></b>, in "Rivista Ingauna e Intemelia", V, 1, January-March 1950, pp. 1-8":
<p class="mt-3 mb-3 ml-5 mr-5" align="justify">
		
			<i>&laquo;On 9 February the first amphorae were hoisted on board, and the interest of the press and the public immediately became spasmodic, 
			creating serious obstacles to work. Nonetheless, it was an unforgettable impression to see the intact amphorae come up on board, in clusters of 
			five or six, tied to a double knot with a rope by the divers who were working on the bottom, covered by the vivid colors of the marine fauna, that 
			become extinct after a few minutes, of algae, limestone deposits and secular molluscs.&raquo;</i>
						</p>						
<p class="mb-3" align="justify"> 
The <b>total measurements</b> of the wreck were carried out in <b>1961</b>, between July and October. When it was found, it was in an almost horizontal position on the bottom and 
it was protected by a <b>blanket of alluvial mud</b>, which <b>saved</b> the lower parts from destruction. After the complete survey of 1961, the <b>first excavation</b> was carried 
out in the summer of <b>1962</b>. The campaign was soon interrupted because the amphora-field exceeded the depth limit allowed for undertaking the works.
</p>
<p class="mb-3" align="justify"> 
The most important results were achieved during the campaigns of the years <b>1970 - 1971</b>.
During these campaigns it was possible to see that the layers of <b>amphorae</b> were at least four. The excavation also allowed to identify the mast, that had a diameter of about 50 cm.
